This increases surface area for pancreatic lipase to act, enabling efficient hydrolysis of triglycerides into monoglycerides and fatty acids, which then form micelles for absorption. Without emulsification, lipid digestion and absorption are severely impaired.",

Tubular secretion is an active and selective transport process in which substances (e.g., H+, K+, drugs, creatinine) are transported from peritubular capillaries into the tubular lumen to be excreted. Filtration primarily removes plasma fluid; secretion fine-tunes composition and removes additional wastes.",

Aldosterone (from the adrenal cortex) increases Na+ reabsorption and K+ secretion in the distal tubule/collecting duct by upregulating ENaC and Na+/K+ pumps; water follows the reabsorbed sodium, expanding blood volume and affecting blood pressure (affects sodium and indirectly water).",
